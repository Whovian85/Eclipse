        <p> We want to live and work in a world where high-quality crops, clean water, closed loop economies, and renewable sources of energy are a shared way of life for industry and consumers. Most of all, we want a world with dramatically lowered carbon emissions and a secure climate. </p>
        <p> After a decade of delivering strong sustainability results, in March 2018, we were proud to announce our most ambitious set of sustainability goals ever to help realize this world. Our 2025 goals are focused on four, vital SDG areas where we – in partnership with our suppliers, NGOs, governements, and others – can most move the world forward: </p>

                            <p> Brewing and distributing beer require intense amounts of electricity and energy. So do many of our value chain processes, from growing barley, to cooling products at the point-of-sale or in consumers’ homes. Managing energy usage and emissions brings benefits to every business including efficiencies, mitigation of risks, and increases effectiveness in process. Our focus on energy efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) reduction is both external and internal and we are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency of our operations, through the use of cleaner fuels, reduced fuel consumption, and shift to eco-friendly coolers. </p>

Barley is the primary grain in beer, and as the biggest purchaser of barley, it is our focal crop. Our other brewing crops include rice, corn, hops, sorghum and cassava. We source from more than 50,000 farmers globally, and our 180 agronomists work alongside them in fields around the world to promote smart, sustainable agricultural practices. </p>

                              <p> We have an important role to play in driving a more circular world. Today, 43% of our volume is packaged in returnable glass bottles, which are 8x less carbon-intensive than one-way glass bottles. Through our brands and recovery programs in local markets, we work to defend the returnable system and promote it with consumers. </p>
                              <p> Additionally, we are constantly looking for ways to increase the recycled material in our packaging. We support the recovery and re-use of glass, aluminum, and PET, in close collaboration with suppliers and partners. Similarly, we welcome innovations that light-weight our containers or eliminate waste in our verticalized operations. </p>
                              <p>Packaging is also one of the most significant components of our carbon footprint. While 99% of our packaging globally is recyclable, we have a far way to go in closing the full loop and reducing emissions across the lifespan of our products. </p>
